# foamAuto

This is to automate the creation of case files and directories for OpenFOAM.

First step is to create OpenFOAM case directory and meshes from scratch via command line.

Then to connect it with cross platform GUI frameworks for easier use. May be Qt.

As of 1st July 2022, blockMeshDict can be generated.

As of 12th July 2022, snappyHexMesh can be generated. But a lot of testing and debugging are still necessary.

As of 12th July 2022, case directory creation functionality is initiated.

As of 23rd July 2022, boundary conditions can be created as a part of case directory creation functionality.

This code is stll very raw and it has a lot of hard coded parts. 

Advices, opinions and coordination are highly welcomed!
