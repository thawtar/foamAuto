# foamAuto

This is to automate the creation of case files and directories for OpenFOAM.

First step is to create OpenFOAM case directory and meshes from scratch via command line.

Then to connect it with cross platform GUI frameworks for easier use. May be Qt.

As of 1st July 2022, blockMeshDict can be generated.

This code is stll very raw and it has a lot of hard coded parts. 

Advices, opinions and coordination are highly welcomed!
